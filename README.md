# Exercise: Astronomical Observations

## Objective
Create a Java application that records astronomical observations, handles possible exceptions, performs calculations with large numbers, and manages dates of observations.

## Problem
Write a Java program that:

- Defines a Record for astronomical observations.
- Calculates and stores large astronomical values using BigInteger.

- Handles possible exceptions gracefully.
- Manages dates of observations using LocalDate.

## Steps

- Define a Record named Observation with fields for the observation date, the name of the celestial body, and the distance from Earth (in kilometers).
- Create a method to calculate the distance in astronomical units (AU), handling large numbers with BigInteger.

- Create a method to record an observation, ensuring that the date is not in the future.
- Handle exceptions such as invalid dates and arithmetic exceptions.

- Create a main class to demonstrate the functionality.
